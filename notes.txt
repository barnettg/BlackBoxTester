to do:
    Verify observers work in each module they are used.
    remove the debug print and change to observers and/or python logging
    complete rest of model_test1.py to test ethernet and running on closed project, and logging to file.
    Add versions to main files and BlackBoxTesterModel - use to verify project file structure
    Add version to project file structure -- ver.txt?
    remove non-existant files listed by comparing to list of current files.
    ScriptManager/ConfigurationManager test:
       get current path and rel from there                                                      DONE
        generate a config file , read/write file list, read/write other parts, then delete
     don't run script unless selected
     change run methods in test scripts to args kwargs and return a dictionary of passed param
     need to complete ScriptManager-->run_scripts as a thread
     register observer in ScriptManager to get script run results and other info
     ScriptManager-->run_scripts -- later to add data from the helper class written from script to be passed to the notify method
